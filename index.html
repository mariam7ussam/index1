    <p>
        i want to say sorry for how i acted a while ago.<br>
        I'm sorry for everything i've said and for all the times i hurt you. <br>
        I know I said some hurtful things , but I didnâ€™t really mean them, You know that I love you more than anything.
         You'll always be in my heart and i'll always choose you over anyone else in the universe,
        my life became so much better ever since you became a part of it
       and you were the first person to ever truly make it feel worth living, i have never loved anyone as i love you.
         thank you for the warm feelings you gave me <br>
        Please accept my apology, i really wish i could hug you now<br>
        love you.
    </p>
